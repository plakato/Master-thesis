\chapter{Generation}
Writing a lyrics for a song is a task that requires creativity. This is one of a few areas where AI has not become better than humans yet. While it is generally capable of keeping similar structure and topic, it still fails use rhymes and other literary devices.

As described in section \ref{generation_tools}, current state-of-art tool for generation is GPT-3 \cite{brown2020gpt3}. We have sent several requests for their API but have not received a reply to this day.

The second-best option was its earlier version GPT-2 (\cite{radford2019gpt2}). It offers pre-trained models of sizes small, medium, large, and XL that can be further fine-tuned to the specific task. Since training models of such sizes has very high memory requirements, we would only be able to fine-tune the small model on available school clusters. 

However, our colleagues from UFAL institute at Charles University agreed to let us generate on GPT-2 XL that they are using in their ongoing research project THEaiTRE (\cite{rosa2021theaitre}). It is a vanilla model, meaning that it has not been fine-tuned to specific task and we do not have resources to fine-tune it. But as their research confirms, it is not necessary because it adapts very well when given a relevant primer. Knowing it has been trained on 8 million web pages, it is highly probable that it has already seen our data (or some similar web containing lyrics data). 

Without fine-tuning, the quality of the result depends on the selection of the primer. To choose what works the best, we decided to compare the results using primers of different lengths. For starters, we tried one-line primer. As expected, it was not enough for GPT-2 to recognize it as poetry, and it continued with full paragraph as you can see in Figure \ref{fig_1line_primer}.

	\color{blue}In most other aspects, I think the two camps in this debate can agree. We're in good company, for instance, as far as the law is concerned. When it comes to the "should" part of the debate, the fact that some states have no-fault insurance mandates, and others have them, is not a matter of opinion, or of opinion alone. \\

\end{figure} 

Subsequently, we iteratively increased the length of the primer exponentially. We conducted experiments with several song lyrics, but the results did not differ very much, so we show one example in Table \ref{generation_result}.

Except for the 4-line primer, it was able to successfully replicate the poem-like structure. It also used a lot of repetition, even when the original text did not contain any (e.g. 2-line primer). We assume, it must have already learned that repetition is very common for this text structures. However, it was not successful in creating rhymes of its own. 

Although longer primer seems to be a safer path to good result, it does not seem to be significantly better than the result from 2-line primer. Occasionally, it appears to miss the clue and continue with regular text, as it did with 4-line primer here.

	 	So why do we make up the terms?\\
	 	It's not just us who insist on the word house, we use it in all sorts of other contexts too. For example, if you want to use a single word to refer to a group of people, you might say:\\
	 	If you want to invite everyone to an event, you might say:\\
	 	It's not hard to see why we seem to love using a term like 'house' to refer to a group of people – it's the easiest word for us to remember.
