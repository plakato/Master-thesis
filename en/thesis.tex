% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
We explore a dataset of almost half a million song lyrics through three different processes -- automatic evaluation, visualization, and generation. We create our own rhyme detector, using EM algorithm with several improvements and adjustable parameters. This may, in some cases, replace human evaluators that cannot be used, for example, after each iteration of lyrics generator to evaluate its improvement. By creating a web-page visualization of the results with interesting matrix rhyme highlighting, we make our evaluation accessible to the public. We discuss interesting genre differences discovered by applying our automatic evaluation on the entire dataset. Finally, we explore lyrics generation using state-of-art GPT-2.
